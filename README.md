# JavaChallenges-
These are solutions to the problems presented in the book "Exercises for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills." These are simple challenges designed to get more familiar with Java, and to improve proficiency with the langauage.  

*RULES*

- Must follow the rules of the task completely; shortcuts and "cheats" can be used, but only if doesn't affect the application.
- Code must be able to compile without any errors.
- Unless specified, all problems are done in pure Java; frameworks can be used if it can speed up the process.
- Code must be reasonably documented; self-explanatory code is excluded.
- This is a timed event; at no time can the clock be stopped. Each challenge will run for a maximum of 30 minutes.
- If no solution can be "found," then the challenge is considered a failure, and everything must be done over again.
- Research on how to complete the challenges is encouraged; however, all code written must be of one's own work, and not someone else's.
- For each member you add to a team, subtract 5 minutes from the total allotted time (int x = 30, x - 5 = y, where y = new time).

*DESIRED QUALITIES*

- Minimal and clean code (less lines = more efficiency)
- Reasonably documented, with explanations on how everything works
- Frameworks that could possibly work for solutions, preferably ones that haven't been used yet
- 

*CONTRIBUTION*

If you have a faster or more efficient solution to the challenges presented in this repository, please clone the repository and push the changes, so that they can be reviewed. For the time being, all proposed solutions must be done in Java; ALL OTHER LANGUAGES WILL BE REJECTED. Proposed solutions must EXPLAIN WHY THE SOLUTION IS BETTER THAN THE ONE CURRENTLY IN PLACE. Solutions without explanations WILL BE REJECTED.
